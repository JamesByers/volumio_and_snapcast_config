## V1 multi-room configuration
This page describes the steps to successfully create the "V1 configuration" abd set up a multi-room Sonos-like system using Raspberry Pis, Volumio and Snapcast Snapserver and Snapclient.
It is expected that at some point Volumio2 project will add this capability directly to the Volumio2 software and provide a UI for managing the nodes.  In the mean time here are the configuration steps that worked for me.

In the"V1" configuration we will create two nodes on a network.  One is the master node that runs the Volumio2 networked music player.  The second node runs Raspbian with the Snapcast Snapclient installed.
